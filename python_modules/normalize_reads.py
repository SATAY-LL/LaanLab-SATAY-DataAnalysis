    '''
    This function normalizes the number of reads.
    It accepts a dataframe that is created using the function dna_features in genomicfeatures_dataframe_with_normalization.py.
    The normalization procedure is based on the method used in Gallagher et.al. 2011.
    This normalizes the reads for the gene length, differences in the number of mapped reads between experiments and the inhomogeniety in the number of insertions within a
    chromosome.
    
    The output of the function is the same dataframe, dna_df2, to which now three more columns are added considering the normalization.
    The first is the normalization described before, the second column is the same normalization, but only for the central part of the gene (for the other genomic features the
    entire feature is taken in consideration) and the third column contains an extra normaliztion where the average number of reads in the noncoding regions in a window are
    defined as fitness 1.
    Also it returns a list including the basepairs where the windows end.
